# deep_call_hedger

A Python package for learning optimal hedges by a deep feed forward neural network (DFNN) in order to minimize terminal loss for a European call option. 

### FEATURES
- Simulates stock prices following a geometric Brownian motion
- Calculates call prices under the Black Scholes model
- Trains a DFNN at each timestep on stocks, calls & strike to minimize terminal error
- Runs predictions using the trained model
- Benchmarks model performance against Black Scholes visible in charts, KPIs & KRIs

### REQUIREMENTS
- Python 3.11+ (tested with 3.11.9)
- Required dependencies (see requirements.txt for details):
    numpy==2.1.3
    tensorflow==2.19.0
    scipy==1.16.0
    matplotlib==3.10.5
    seaborn==0.13.2

### INSTALLATION
1. Clone the repository:
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep_call_hedger.git
       cd deep_call_hedger

2. Create & activate your virtual environment:
       python3 -m venv venv
       source venv/bin/activate      # On Mac/Linux
       venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows

3. Install dependencies:
       pip install -r requirements.txt

### USAGE
1. Train the deep hedging model (or use the pretrained model deep_hedging_64.keras):
       python main_training.py
   -> Saves a trained ".keras" model to the models/ folder.

2. Run prediction & analysis:
       python main_prediction.py
   -> Uses the trained model to run simulations & generate plots.
